# Inspiration

I have been facinated with LEDs ever since I saw my first light show back in early 2014, and always wanted the top of the line gloves so that I could customize the modes as much as possible. I've noticed that led diffusers have not made any significant advancements and feel little bored with what is avaiable. So then I bought my Prusa i3 MK3s 3D printer, and got to work developing what I call _______ (To Be Announced)!
